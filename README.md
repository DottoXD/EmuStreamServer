# EmuStreamServer
An incomplete project that was supposed to be an emulator streaming server, to stream emulated games from your browser.
At the moment this only streams the server's screen and serves as a placeholder for FFMpeg streaming. Latency isn't good and the same can be said about video quality.

# How to use?
You can start this with `npm run start:prod` after installing all the dependencies with `npm i`.
Open `localhost:3000` in your browser and you'll be able to see your own screen (since game streaming hasn't been implemented yet).
